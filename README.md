        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who tried to go through the teamTreehouse Techdegree on the 25$/ month plan. I've found that in order to enjoy the full range of what they have to offer, including the ability to download and follow the coding in my own code editor has been profoundly different even within the first project I'm starting with them.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional server and bar-tender and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence.</p>
          <p>The background-image I used is, unfortunately, not indicitive of where I live. It only portrays what I wish it looked like. I am excited to grow in development, so as to have the option of going somewhere like this whenever I please.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I used to watch and play basketball. I enjoy reading my bible and other literature. There are a few things I am working on while we figure out how life is sopposed to be moving forward:</p>
        <ul class="hobbies">
          <li>Nutrition</li>
          <li>Fitness</li>
          <li>Spiritual Health</li>
          <li>Learning a new skill</li>
          <li>Gaining employment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work at something that I truly enjoy. I have never found that before and necer would have if God didn't open this window of opportunity. He knows what he is doing.</p>
